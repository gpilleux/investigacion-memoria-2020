# [DEF CON 23: Hacking Websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8AhfDEKUQ4&t=0s)
> Speaker: Brent White

## Evidence Gathering
**KeepNote**. Paste screenshots, create scripts, embedded pages, folders.
**Document**
* HTTP Request and Response for each vulnerability
* Unscheduled downtime or issues
* Changes in test data
* Log all monetary transactions
* List all known affected pages and Parameters for a vulnerability

Have methodology and check-list

## Discovery / OSINT
Search engines, Pastebin, ShodanHQ, Recon-NG, etc for anything related to the app.
* It's manual and time consuming
* Email archives, logins, dev, help forums
* Any leaked credentials, known previous hacks?
* Sites like urlvoid.com to check for known actve malware/threats for the domain

**Discover by Lee Baird**. OSINT tool
## Automated Scanning
* Nessus. Looks at host and web app. SSL/TLS layer, content discovery, basic CGI vulns, ...
* IBM App Scan. SQL/LDAP injections, CSRF, XSS, ...
* Nikto
* WPScanner, Wordpress Scanner
* OWASP Dirbuster

**Note**: *Modify default settings*

## Manual Testing
* Review server response to help verify what the server is running (IIS, Apache)
* Look for parameters to fuzz
	* How do they handle characters and commands outside of the normal actions?	
* Parameters can be in URL and/or HTTP POST requests
* Try XSS payloads, Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL/LDAP injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
* Is sensitive info passed through URL in GET request?
	* usernames, passwords, session ID, etc
* Look for comments in source code of HTTP Responses
* **Authentication**. Can it be bypassed or broken?
	* Can you access URLs and functions as unauthenticated that you could as logged in?
	* Can you re-use the session token after logging off? Is there a "log off" feature?
	* Can you have multiple sessions as the same user at the same time?
	* What are the password requirements?
	* Can you re-use a previous password?
* Look at the host, not just the web app
	* Apache, IIS? If old/outdated install, look for exploits
	* Admin portal available?
		* cPanel, Apache Tomcat Manager, etc
	* Are there test and default credentials available?
	* Search for backup, default and obsolete files
	* Is directory browsing enabled? What about directory rights?
	* Look for dangerous HTTP methods (PUT, COPY, DELETE, TRACE)
	* Are they vulnerable to directory traversal, Shellshock, Heartbleed, ...
	* Use Nmap to see other ports/services open to public
	*
