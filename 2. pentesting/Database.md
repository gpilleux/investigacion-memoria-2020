# Database Penetration Testing

**Database Vulnerability Assessments** are integral to a systematic and proactive approach to database security. This form of penetration testing reduces the risk associated with both web- and database-specific attacks, and is often required for compliance with relevant standards, laws & regulations.

### Methodology typically includes:

-   Leveraging an open-source or commercial database vulnerability assessment tool to discover known database security vulnerabilities; and,
-   Formal reporting on the process, gap analysis, relevant findings, and mitigation roadmap. Where possible the report will also include; root cause analysis, peer-group benchmarking, good practice benchmarking, executive summaries, and technical summaries.

### The predominant benefits realized by a Database Vulnerability Assessment:

-   Quickly identify configuration errors, default settings, coding errors, and patch management issues in an automated manner in an economical fashion;
-   Capable of being run on automated, regular basis to provide baseline and ongoing vulnerability management metrics; and,
-   Can be used to focus other database assessment activities on those areas of greatest concern.

### Database Vulnerability Assessments are best used

-   As a quick and inexpensive means of assessing the risk associated with a database that is in operation but has not (recently) gone through a broader database security assessment;
-   As part of an ongoing vulnerability/configuration management program, especially in support of demonstration of ongoing compliance with relevant standards/regulations;
-   To assess less critical databases (i.e., databases with a moderate risk profile where the risk does not justify greater extent and rigor; and,
-   As an information gathering mechanism to focus penetration testing or code reviews.
