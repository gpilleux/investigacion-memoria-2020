# Pentesting Methodology
-   Ensure we have a clean testing platform (revert snapshot/wipe and rebuild, etc.).
-   Notify you that testing will start in 30 minutes.
-   Enumerate the environment. This will, at a minimum, generate a list of live hosts and open services. Ideally, this will also identify the version of the services and the operating system.
-   Analyze the services in the environment. The goal here is to identify potential routes of entry and points of exploitation. This could involve any of the following:
    -   Vulnerability scanning
    -   Configuration review
    -   General information gathering (i.e., shares, error messages, network traffic, etc.)
-   Identify hosts and services of interest.
-   Build and execute the attack plan. We methodically document the test plan (what is to be tested, how and why). This generally includes multiple actionable plans of attack; e.g.:
    -   Vulnerability identified (this could be anything from a missing patch to seeing LM hashes on the network)
    -   Exploit type/avenue of attack
    -   Expected result
-   Upon executing an attack plan, we document the actual results. We continue until an End of Test condition is met.
-   Collect evidence and clean up any testing remnants on the network. If we cannot safely clean up a testing artifact, we alert all the people we identified in the kickoff step above.
-   Notify you that all testing has concluded.
-   Ensure all documentation and evidence is contained within the reporting system.
-   Remove any of your data from our testing platform. We are careful to wipe not only collected evidence, but also tool logs that could contain your data.

**Step #1.** It starts with a list of Vulnerabilities/potential problem areas that would cause a security breach for the system.  
**Step #2.** If possible, this list of items is ranked in the order of priority/criticality  
**Step #3.** Devise penetration tests that would work (attack your system) from both within the network and outside (externally) are done to determine if you can access data/network/server/website unauthorized.  
**Step #4.** If unauthorized access is possible, then the system has to be corrected and the series of steps need to be re-run until the problem area is fixed.


# Reporting
A comprehensive well-written and easy-to-understand report is essential for the full value of a penetration test to be realized.

You are paying for an expert’s knowledge, observations and opinions. The report you receive should convey these clearly.

The report will contain a narrative of the test plan execution, including any evidence collected. Our standard procedure is to include sensitive information. Confidential information will be visibly redacted if it must be included.

In addition, it’s crucial reports cover all three of these areas:

1.  High reliability and accuracy. Our quality assurance (QA) process is extremely rigorous. No report is sent out until it validated by at least two subject matter experts who did not participate in creating it.
2.  Easy-to-read. Your report will be written so that someone non-technical, possibly in an upper management role, can understand it easily.
3.  Provides actionable guidance. Your report will contain clearly defined steps that explain how to close the security gaps discovered during the testing.

To ensure the report meets your needs, we will review the report with you in person or via a screen share. This ensure that you understand what was discovered, and if and how we reached an End of Test condition; and to assist in planning any recommended remediation.
