# Physical Penetration Test

**Physical security** is the most basal form of Information Security. Physical security describes the ability of a business to protect their information from physical attacks, like an intruder stealing a laptop or accessing private information while an employee is away from their desk.

Cautionary measures may include locks, sensors, camera systems, and other devices that are designed to prevent an intruder from gaining physical access to your business. A failure of these controls can immediately result in the theft of a laptop, access to an internal network, access to a wiring closet, or even access to a data center.

### Physical Penetration Testing may include such activities as:

-   Attempting to gain access to critical infrastructure or Executive area in a Control Center and/or Service Center;
-   Attempting to gain access to any satellite facilities/branches.

## Which systems will be evaluated by a physical penetration test?

-   Barriers (Fences, access to parking garage, etc.)
-   Doors and locks (Password protection, Piggybacking vulnerability)
-   Guards on duty
-   Surveillance (Cameras, Motion Sensors)
-   Deterrents (Alarm system)
-   Desktop Security Measures (Password safety, Session timeouts)

## What are the risks of physical vulnerability?

-   Fence hopping
-   Tailgating (Similar to piggybacking)
-   Physical Access Hacking
-   Social Engineering
-   Stolen Laptop or Other Equipment
-   Breach of Private Company Data
-   Upload of Malicious Software
