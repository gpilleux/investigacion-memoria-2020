#### **The Benefits of Application Penetration Testing**

Application Penetration Tests provide:

-   A way to address issues and prevent future incidents

### How Does Application Pen Testing Work?

During an Application Penetration Test, a Pivot Point Security engineer simulates a real life attack on your application’s security controls to gain access to sensitive data. Unlike an automated scan, our hands-on approach provides intelligent and customized responses, avoids false positives, and demonstrates the effects of actual vulnerabilities within an application. Application Pen Testing lets you know whether a real world hacker could do real harm to your system and your company.
